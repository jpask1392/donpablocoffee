It keeps the coffee compounds intact. This is the crucial, it is the real secret to enhance the taste of your coffee at home. Grind size has a tremendous effect on the outcome of the brew as it determines the flow of water through the grounds. Choosing the grind size will depend on the type of brewing, and the final taste you desire i.e. American, Espresso, Turkish, Classic or Latte. The finer the grind, the larger the surface area of the coffee bean exposed. This ultimately allows greater extraction of the coffee particles such as flavor compounds, solid, and oils. <br><br>A general concept of grinding takes into consideration the length of time ground coffee is in contact with water, and the temperature and pressure they are brewed at. Exemplifying this, Espresso requires quite a fine grind; whereas, French press is partial to the other end of the spectrum, a coarse grind. The type of roast can be a variable in altering grind size as well. For example, if you are brewing with a lighter roast you could grind the beans finer, to achieve a deeper extraction. Later on, you will find our recommended grind size for each coffee brewing method.<\/p>"

Inferior quality water will inevitably affect the quality of your brewed cup in a negative way. Use fresh spring, mineral, or filtered water. Keep the water clean and pure for tastiest brews.<\/li>\n<li>Water composition is very important because the minerals in the water are essential to the extraction process while brewing. It is worth mentioning that if water is not clean, or contain intruding elements like chloride or any other, the extracting process, is disturbed directly altering the flavor of your infusion.<\/li>\n<li>Water temperature to brew our specialty coffee should be between 185°F (85°C) and 195°F (91°C) for optimal extraction. Generally speaking; the lower end of this temperature spectrum works well for darker roasts while the higher end can be more efficient for lighter roasts. If you do not have a water thermometer, a practical application is to boil the water and let it stand for two minutes, or add a splash of cold water before mixing it with the grounds. Most automated or electrical coffee brewing systems will account for temperature and\/or allow you to set it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>"

              "accordionBody": "<p>When it comes to enjoying a cup of coffee, freshness is of top importance. The process of roasting the coffee beans plays a huge role in the quality of your cup of coffee. After being roasted, coffee needs time to “rest.” During this time, coffee releases gases, and develops the oils and aromatic compounds that rise to the top of the beans, to provide the coffee optimum flavor and aroma. We take care of this stage, and package our whole beans at peak freshness. After roasting, we let our coffee rest, to then package it. It helps our Coffee stay fresher longer as whole bean. Once you grind the beans at home, oxidation starts to take place and deterioration begins. We recommend fresh roasted coffee beans to be freshly ground directly before you brew; this ensures the freshest and best cup of coffee.\n<\/p>\n<p class=\"pt-4\"><b>ROAST STYLE AND STRENGTH<\/b><\/p>\n<ul class=\"has-coffee-bean-bullets\">\n<li>Do you like your coffee “strong”? in the coffee world, strong coffee doesn’t mean caffeinated or bitter coffee. The strength refers to its richness, or satisfying fullness in flavor, body, and acidity. The strengths in the coffee is reached by the brewing ratio.<\/li>\n<li>Caramelization of the natural sugars in the bean: a darker roast fully caramelizes the natural sugars in the coffee bean, adding a “punch of flavor” but reducing its body and natural flavor character. A dark roast will stand up through copious amount of cream and sweetener.<\/li>\n<li>Medium-dark roast, makes a very satisfying rich brew, that reveals the natural flavor of the bean, and ensures that the coffee is smooth with a clean finish and pleasant aftertaste. (Note: besides being my personal favorite roast, it is our best seller by far, and it is my opinion, that many people who drink dark roasts, would actually enjoy a medium-dark roast more, if they knew how to drink it… so we really want to sell it here).<\/li>\n<\/ul>"

There’s simply no substitute for fresh, recently-roasted coffee, so we’ve structured our business to ensure you get the freshest cup possible every time. We roast our coffee to-order instead of roasting on a production schedule like our competitors, and we keep the supply chain short, with no coffee sitting in warehouses and DC's getting stale while we wait for an order to be placed. This ensures you get a freshly-roasted batch. Our process guarantees an unmatched flavor, freshness, and clean finish – and you can smell the difference from the moment you open the bag. <\/p>",

The creation of a framework for sharing a percentage of sales with growers, and in some cases others in the supply chain, when program benchmarks are reached in the areas of labor, sustainability, environment, and quality, could achieve significant mutually-beneficial results.<\/p><p><\/p><p>The key to Burke Brands LLC program is incentives and rewards, not charity or subsidies. Empowering growers and providing them with an incentive to help improve their own communities and protect their environment, and rewarding them for their achievements, is essential to the success of the program.<\/p><p><\/p><p>The Sharing Certified program provides the growers an unlimited potential for gain. Under the program they must be successful in reaching labor, sustainability, and environmental benchmarks, and they must also follow guidelines for producing better quality coffee; when they produce better quality coffee, the roaster\/marketer and retailer is able to sell more coffee, and in-turn more money comes back to the growers to help them reach the next set of benchmarks. The Sharing Certified system offers growers a chance to participate in the free enterprise system as we know it in the US. It also gives them a dream, makes them work for it, and helps them succeed to the benefit of themselves, their families, their communities, and the environment.<\/p><p><\/p><p>The Sharing Certified system was developed organically. The founders of Burke Brands LLC recognized an opportunity to capitalize on their relationships in the coffee growing regions of Colombia, by offering higher than market prices for a better grade of coffee, and then offering a percentage of roasted coffee sales to the farmers if they agreed to, and invested the money in, implementing programs that seek to improve the following key areas of their operations:<\/p>",

Sharing Certified does not provide incentives for, or encourage growers to seek unearned certifications for economic benefit. Rather, it is a transparent program that seeks to create ownership among consumers by sharing progress made by farmers toward specific goals.
